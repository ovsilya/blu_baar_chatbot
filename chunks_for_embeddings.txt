Historical aspects:
The history of the property at Zugerstrasse 57 in Baar has changed considerably over the last 100 years.
10 years ago:
By 2014, Zugerstrasse 57 was already a location for major international companies such as Partners Group, a global investment firm active in the private markets sector. At that time, it offered services in the field of asset management and financial advice
50 years ago:
In the 1970s, Baar was known as a business location above all due to its rapid development. During this time, the region began its transformation into an important financial and industrial hub. Large companies such as Lego also had production facilities here
100 years ago:
Around 1920, the area around Baar was still strongly agricultural. Zugerstrasse, including number 57, was part of a rural village that stretched mainly along the road between Lake Zug and Lake Zurich . The region only began to experience greater industrialization and commercialization after the Second World War



Why is Blu-Baar called that?
"Blu" is a phonetic allusion to the word "blue" and refers to the tinted glass façade of the property, which reflects in a characteristic shade of blue. This concise terminology symbolises the striking blue reflection of the façade. On the one hand, the term "Baar" refers to the location of the building, and on the other hand, "bar" can also be understood as "bar" in English. This results in the image of a "blue bar" – a perfect combination of location and design.
The brand of the Blu-Baar commercial property is based on a clear, modern and effective property identity. Here is a detailed explanation of the brand philosophy:
1. Naming and meaning
· "Blu" refers to the building's striking, blue reflective glass façade. This façade gives the property a modern and self-confident appearance. The reflection of the façade is emblematic of the clarity and innovative character of the building.
· "Baar" specifies the location and anchors the building locally in the Zug/Baar region. This regional location is important in order to establish a close connection to the micro-location.



2. International and language-neutral conciseness
The name "Blu-Baar" is deliberately short, memorable and easy to pronounce. It works in a language-neutral manner in various international contexts, which gives the brand a universal character and also makes it easy to understand on a global level.
3. Memorability and recognition
· Due to its brevity and distinctive sound, "Blu-Baar" is easily noticeable. This contributes to a high level of recognition, both for potential tenants and business partners.
· The name is flexible and can be applied in different usage scenarios, for example as Blu Gastro, Blu Business or Blu Education, depending on the future use of the property.



4. Visual identity
· The logo is a sans serif typeface mark that focuses on simplicity and room for ideas. It is easy to use both physically and digitally.
· The spacing of the logo symbolizes room for ideas, while the clean lines of the sans serif font signal high flexibility and efficiency. The reduced "R" in the logo stands for a clear, efficient focus.
5. Strong building identity
· The Blu-Baar brand aims to be not just a temporary marketing brand, but to create a long-term identity for the building. The brand is intended to give the building a strong identifying feature in the Zug/Baar area that has a lasting effect.
The "Blu-Baar" brand thus combines modern design, local roots and international comprehensibility, giving the property a strong, recognizable identity that goes beyond mere marketing



Project description (cst, 24.9.24 patchwork various sources):
1. Description
The modern office space in Baar, in the canton of Zug, offers companies a first-class location in the Zurich metropolitan region. Geographically, Baar is located between Lake Zug and the hills of the Zugerberg, embedded in an economically dynamic region with a high quality of life. The community itself is characterized by a cosmopolitan and tolerant population that offers a pleasant environment for employees and companies.
Baar has excellent transport connections:
The trains from Baar Neufeld to Zürich Hauptbahnhof run with an approximate frequency of 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the time of day and the line. The connection to Lucerne runs via the IR70 line, which departs every 30 minutes. Trains to Zurich run at minute 10 and to Lucerne at minute 9.
· Zurich: approx. 25 km away, 30 minutes by car or 40 minutes by train
· Train: about 10 km away, 15 minutes by car or 10 minutes by train
· Lucerne: approx. 35 km away, 40 minutes by car or 50 minutes by train
This central location allows companies and employees to commute quickly and efficiently, which further increases the attractiveness of the location. Zug is a leading economic center in Switzerland, characterized by low corporate taxes and business-friendly policies. This has attracted numerous international companies, especially from the financial services, technology and pharmaceutical sectors. The economic environment promotes innovation and contributes to stability and growth in the region.



2. Space supply
The available office space comprises a generous total area of 8,946 m², which will be available as a single-tenant property from the beginning of 2026. The area layout is as follows:
· Ground floor: 2,247 m²
· 1st floor: 2,028 m²
· 2nd floor: 2,076 m²
· 3rd floor: 1,105 m²
· Size: 1'490 m²
The spaces are fully customizable and offer companies the opportunity to develop tailor-made room concepts. Whether team rooms, meeting rooms, creative areas or retreat zones for concentrated work – the offices can be flexibly adapted to the specific needs of the tenants. Modern working concepts such as open-space structures or desk-sharing models can also be implemented without any problems.
The desk share ratio is a land use principle that is also becoming established in Switzerland in the wake of the increasing spread of remote work models. This makes it possible to use office space efficiently by defining a ratio of workplaces to employees. A ratio of 1:1.5 or 1:2 is often aimed for in order to promote the use of common areas and reduce the need for fixed workplaces.
The space on offer also offers the opportunity to implement contemporary forms of work based on the principle of New Work . New Work does not describe a fixed structure, but inspires companies to optimize their office concepts in such a way that they support modern, flexible ways of working such as remote work and agile methods. The room layout can be adapted to individual requirements in order to offer employees an optimal working environment



3. Highlights
The office space in Baar not only offers flexibility in design, but also a variety of amenities that can be of great importance for potential tenants and their employees. Aspects such as health promotion and sustainable workplace design are an important part of many companies' corporate culture and make a significant contribution to the well-being of their employees.
A sports room with showers and cloakrooms, for example, offers the opportunity to integrate sporting activities into everyday working life. A separate canteen on the 4th floor provides fresh, healthy and sustainable catering options. Providing vegetarian, vegan and allergy-friendly meals can support employees in their diet and promote productivity. The use of regional and seasonal ingredients shows the commitment to sustainable and responsible supply, which is important both ecologically and socially.
The design of the working environment and additional offers such as quiet zones or retreat rooms are important factors that companies should consider in order to ensure the well-
being of their employees in the long term. These aspects are a central element of modern workplace concepts and offer companies the opportunity to create a healthy and productive environment that meets the current needs of the workplace.



4. Equipment
The Blu-Baar's equipment and additional services support modern work concepts such as New Work and offer a variety of amenities that promote the well-being of employees. Key highlights include:
· Sunny, spacious terrace: ideal for breaks and outdoor relaxation.
· Canteen / café on the 2nd floor: Fresh, healthy and sustainable catering options, including vegetarian and vegan options.
· Fitness/Sports/Dance Room: Equipped with natural light, showers and cloakrooms to integrate sports activities into everyday work.
· 110 parking spaces and 30 outdoor parking spaces: For employees and visitors.
· Flexible room design: Possibility to implement individual office layouts and open-space structures.



5. Tax advantages and location attractiveness
Compared to Zurich, Baar offers significant tax advantages with a corporate tax rate of around 13.0%. This is significantly cheaper than in Zurich, where the rate is around 21.0%, resulting in significant financial benefits for companies setting up in the region.
Baar combines economic strength with a high quality of life, which makes the location particularly attractive for international companies. The proximity to important economic centers as well as the availability of recreational and leisure opportunities such as Lake Zug and the Zugerberg contribute to the fact that employees can enjoy an excellent work-life balance.
